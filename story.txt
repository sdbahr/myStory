Bob woke up on a Friday morning and realized all of his cereal had vanished. 
No more lucky charms, no more cinnamon toast crunch, no more nothing.
He knew something wasn't right as he felt his left side turning numb, and felt his arteries clogged. 
Bob doesn't have any friends, no one to share his life with, and hasn't been successful throughout his searches on Christian mingle. 
He can't explain the phenonmeon; however, he decided to call the sheriff to see whether he could solve the mystery. 
Nice story.

"We need to get you some Fruit Loops stat!" exclaimed the sheriff.
"That must be the only explanation for this. I'll call an ambulance right away!"
Bob breathed a sigh of relief that help was on its way.

But when the ambulance came they actually brought Trix. Bad enough before they could give it to him the rabbit 
came and stole it.

Bob eventually lost all hope and accepted his fate. He went back to his house, jumped on his laptop, and went straight 
to Christian mingle. Bob full of emotion changed his bio to "Looking for my Captain Crunch, the Christian Dior, of the
Christian Dior's, Let me know if found". Suddendly, Bob's head smacked his screen and Bob was pronounced dead.
