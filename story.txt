Bob woke up on a Friday morning and realized all of his cereal had vanished. 
No more lucky charms, no more cinnamon toast crunch, no more nothing.
He knew something wasn't right as he felt his left side turning numb, and felt his arteries clogged. 
Bob doesn't have any friends, no one to share his life with, and hasn't been successful throughout his searches on Christian mingle. 
He can't explain the phenonmeon; however, he decided to call the sheriff to see whether he could solve the mystery. 
Nice story.
